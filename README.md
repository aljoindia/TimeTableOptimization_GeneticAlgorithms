# TimeTableOptimization_GeneticAlgorithms
Attempted to generate optimal time tables using genetic alrgorithms along with certain constraints such as no teacher can teach two classes in one time slot, no two classes can be taught by one teacher in one time slot, among others to build a basic non-colliding set of timetables.
